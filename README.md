## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshots

-You can find the screenshots of the project on the screenshots folder.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS styling (Flexbox, Gradients, etc.)
- JavaScript
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

 HTML:

-Learned how i can limit the amount of characters of an input using maxlength attribute.

 CSS:

-Learned different variantions of hover, focus, placeholder, selections effects.

-Learned how do to deal with gradients.

-Learned how outline and cursor properties work.

-Learned more properties of flexbox.

-Learned more about borders(with gradients), and some new background properties.

-Learned how to apply different fonts for different parts of the project.


 JS:

-Learned some new ways of DOM manipulation.

-Learned more about the 'addEventListener' method.

-Learned how i can manipulate when a part of project shows and when it hides, manipulating the display property in CSS.

-Learned how i can transfer the form data to the textContent of an element.

-Learned how i can make an element after taking the form data (in this case numbers) have some space between one-another every 4 character.

-Learned how to not allow a user to submit the form if he didn't fill the form properly (when one of the inputs require a number or cant be empty, or both).

-Learned how to reset the form after submitting the data.


### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I can say i still have yet to learn more about these languages, because everyday new things get added to these languages, so i will try to be more up-to-date with these.

HTML:

- I want to learn more about semantic HTML tags, because there are still many more HTML tags getting added everyday to make this language even more flexible.

CSS:

- Want to learn more about Flexbox , Grid properties, gradients (making them more complex), pseudo-class and elements, and overall more CSS properties.

JS:

- Want to learn more about DOM manipulation properties and more built -in methods.
